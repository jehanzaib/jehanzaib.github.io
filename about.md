I am co-founder & CTO at [iKnowl][iknowl]. I am passionate about developing solutions for existing problems through technology. I spend most of my day writing software and at times, reading software.  

At [iKnowl][iknowl] I am working on a wearable tech for elderlies and a scalable hosting solution for an average human.

I am also co-founder of a group called hacker9 which writes software for social good.
